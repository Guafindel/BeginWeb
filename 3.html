      W3C announced today the W3C/OGC Joint Workshop Series on Maps for the Web, in September & October, 2020. The event
      is hosted by Natural Resources Canada. The workshop will be online only, spread
      out over a month of video presentations and asynchronous discussion. Attendance is free for all invited
      participants
      and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members. This workshop series
      brings together experts in geographic standards and Web map data services, Web mapping client tools and
      applications, and Web platform standards and browser development, to explore the potential
      of maps for the Web. Expected topics of discussion include: Adding a native map viewer for the Web platform,
      similar
      to how HTML was added for video content; Standardizing how a browser-based map
      viewer fetches data from map services and how that data should be formatted; Creating accessible Web map
      experiences
      that adapt to the different ways people interact with the Web; Creating truly
      global Web map experiences that work with different languages and cartographic practices; Limiting privacy and
      security impacts of a more geo-enhanced Web. For more information on the workshop,
      please see details and submission instructions. Expression of Interest and position statements are due by 30 June
      2020 and registration applications accepted until 31 August 2020.
